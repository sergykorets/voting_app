- :id and :created_at should NOT be in permitted columns
- has_many should define dependent: :destroy of dependent: :nullify
- Do not use t.reference in migrations, use t.integer :something_id, index: true instead. This prevents problems with DB dump loading (t.reference creates foreign keys between tables and table dumps must be loaded in correct order, which is complicated)
- Define DB indexes for columns which are used in WHERE and ORDER statements (and references to other tables of course). In migration index: true of add_index can be used
- In standard portal we do not use login column for users. E-mail is enough
- Don't forget to define validators for required columns, refernces, etc.: validates_presence_of
- voters x elections is n:m reference - requires new table elections_voters and using of has_and_belongs to many
- Filter and search functionality is defined only for "high level" models like candidates, voters and elections, not for votes, participations and other stuff
- Attachment can be defined with 300x300# style. Hash sign means that picture is cropped to this exact size
- Layout with right side should be used also for index actions
- Primary order column should be specified in controller for search and filter actions
- For filters to be working DB extension unaccent must be enabled (migrations)
- show table type :picture must be defined with thumb_style option (generators are not allmighty)
- We need to define election model for election parts - definition of votable dates, etc.
- check <div> </div> pairing when copying some code
- there is nothing like :references type defined for show/index table
- Homepage structure - why so complicated?????? Everything comes from current election -> it breaks to election parts -> each part has some candidate participations. Your solution is much longer and less flexible...
- Homepage HTML - why so complicated HTML markup????? Why too many rows/columns/classes and other shit? It's just simple centered container, one tab, list of panels, each panel is a row with two columns.
